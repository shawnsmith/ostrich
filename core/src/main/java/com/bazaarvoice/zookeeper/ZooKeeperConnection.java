 * change libraries at will.  Currently this just serves as a marker interface with all of the useful functionality
 * hidden inside of an internal implementation class.  In the future this will likely have to change.

 * This class is thread-safe and should be shared among multiple users.  Ideally, there is one per VM per ZooKeeper
